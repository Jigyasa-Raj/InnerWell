InnerWell - Mental Health & Wellness Application
InnerWell is a comprehensive Flutter application designed to support mental health and wellness. With features like journaling, mood tracking tests, curated news, and medicine details lookup, InnerWell offers a holistic approach to mental well-being.

Features
Journaling
InnerWell provides a secure space for users to document their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Whether it's a daily reflection or a moment of inspiration, the journaling feature encourages self-expression and introspection.

Mood Tracking Tests
Users can assess their mental well-being with scientifically validated tests such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale for anxiety. These tests provide valuable insights and help users track their emotional health over time.

Curated News
Stay informed about mental health and wellness topics with InnerWell's curated news feature. Powered by a dedicated API, InnerWell delivers relevant and timely articles, helping users stay up-to-date with the latest developments in mental health research, treatment, and advocacy.

Medicine Details Lookup
InnerWell integrates with the OpenFDA medicine API to provide comprehensive details about medications. Users can simply enter the name of a medication, and InnerWell fetches essential information such as usage instructions, side effects, and precautions, empowering informed decision-making about medication management.
